This application is going to be written with HTML and CSS for the front-end and JavaScript for the backend.
The application will be linked to an API and it's purpose is to answer questions a user may ask it and output a 
simple textbox with the answer thus removing the need to filter through links as you would with a normal
search engine.

Application will include a basic landing page with a textbox that will pass the user's question into an API
that will formulate and deliver back an answer.
